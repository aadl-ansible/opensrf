# ansible-role-opensrf

Ansible role to install and configure OpenSRF. This is based off a few other evergreen ansible installation repos such as [berick/evergreen-ansible-installer](https://github.com/berick/evergreen-ansible-installer/) and [mark-cooper/evergreen-playbook](https://github.com/mark-cooper/evergreen-playbook) along with the install instructions.

This is broken out as it's own role so it can be used independently.
